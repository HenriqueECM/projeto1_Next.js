        <p>I'm a full stack developer (React.js & Node.js) with a focus on creating (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences that are fast, accessible, visually appealing, and responsive. Even though I have been creating web applications for over 7 years, I still love it as if it was something new.</p>
